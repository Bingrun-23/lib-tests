4. Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius $R$, permanently polarized with polarization $\textbf{P} = \alpha \textbf{r}$, where $\textbf{r}$ is the radial vector. The cylinder rotates about its axis with angular velocity $\omega$, where $\omega R \ll c$. Neglect all relativistic effects.
   
   (a) Calculate the electric field $\textbf{E}$ and the magnetic field $\textbf{B}$ both inside and outside the cylinder.

   (b) Determine the electromagnetic energy per unit length of the cylinder.

5. A plane divides space into two regions: one filled with a dielectric of dielectric constant $\epsilon_1$ and the other with dielectric constant $\epsilon_2$. In the $\epsilon_1$ region, a point charge $Q$ is placed at a distance $d$ from the plane.

   (a) For $\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_0$ (vacuum) and $\epsilon_2 = \infty$ (perfect conductor), find the surface charge density distribution on the plane.

   (b) For arbitrary $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, find the surface charge density distribution on the plane.

   (c) Compare the results of (a) and (b), and derive the electric field in the entire space for case (b).

6. Consider a cavity resonator of size $a \times a \times b$ along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. The boundary of the resonator is a perfect conductor, except for the $z=0$ plane, which has a finite conductivity $\sigma_s$. Assume the imperfection does not affect the electromagnetic field distribution inside the resonator. Consider the $TM_{110}$ mode.

   The quality factor of the resonator is defined as
   $$Q = \frac{2\pi f W_{tot}}{P_{dis}},$$
   where $f$ is the frequency of the mode, $W_{tot}$ is the total energy stored in the resonator, and $P_{dis}$ is the power dissipation rate.

   (a) Calculate $W_{tot}$ for the resonator. (Hint: The total energy of the electric field is equal to the total energy of the magnetic field.)

   (b) Given the equation for the energy dissipation rate of a surface,
   $$P_{dis} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{S} \frac{|\alpha|^2}{\sigma_s} dS,$$
   where $\alpha$ is the electric current density on the surface, calculate $P_{dis}$ for the resonator.
