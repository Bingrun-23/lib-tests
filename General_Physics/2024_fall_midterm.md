## Problem 1 Short Response Questions (20 pts)

**(1)** Use the electric field distribution of a point charge to verify the integral form of Gauss Theorem.\
**(2)** Qualitatively or semi-quantitatively explain the phenomenon of a point discharge.\
**(3)** A point charge is placed next to a conductive sphere. The image charge is *inside* the conductive sphere. Does this contradict the principle that there cannot be a charge distribution inside the conductor? Why? Why does the method of image charges provide the correct electric field distribution?\
**(4)** Please explain the reason of polarization from a microscopic perspective. Why there is no polarization charge in an isotropic homogeneous dielectric? Use the relationship between the polarization density and polarization vector, modify the Gauss Theorem.

_Side note_. The last question is essentially requiring you to prove
$$\oint_S \mathbf{D}\cdot \text{d}\mathbf{a}=\int_V \rho_{f} \text{d}V.$$

## Problem 2 (10 pts)
There is a uniform charged circular ring with radius $R$ and charge density $\lambda$, placed at $xOy$ plane with center coinciding with the origin.\
**(1)** Suppose $P$ is at $z$-axis. Find the electric field $\mathbf{E}_P$ at point $P$.\
**(2)** Suppose $A$ is at $xOy$ plane, having distance $r_0$ from the origin. If $r_0\ll R$, find the electric field $\mathbf{E}_A$ at point $A$. **Hint**: Use Gauss Theorem. You can assume that, when $x,y,z\ll R$, $E_z(x,y,z)=E_z(z)$ is invariant of $x,y$.
## Problem 3 (10 pts)
Three point charges: $q,-2q,q$, are placed at $-l,0,l$ on $x$-axis. A point $P$ is on $x$-axis and has distance $r$ from the origin.\
**(1)** What is the dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$ of the system, assume the reference point is the origin of the coordinate? If the reference point changes, do the dipole moment change?\
**(2)** Suppose $r\gg l$. Find the electric field at $P$.
## Problem 4 (5 pts)
A ball has radius $R$ and a hollow sphere inside. This hollow sphere has radius $r$, and its origin has distance $a$ from the origin of the whole ball. Now, the ball is uniformly charged with density $\rho$. Find the electric field in the hollow part. **Hint**: This field is uniform.
## Problem 5 (10 pts)
There are two infinite line charges: the first one has density $\lambda$, and is at line $x=\dfrac{d}{2},y=0$; the second one has density $-\lambda$, and is at line $x=-\dfrac{d}{2},y=0$. At plane $xOy$, let $f(z)=\phi(x,y)+\psi(x,y)\cdot i$, where $\phi$ is the electric potential of the system, and $f$ is an analytic function. Find $f$.
## Problem 6 (15 pts)
**(1)** A uniformly charged ball has radius $R$ and charge density $\rho$. Find its electric energy.\
**(2)** Now, an extra point charge $q$ is placed outside the ball, with distance $d$ from the origin. Find the interactive energy of the point charge and the ball.\
**(3)** Two uniformly charged ball has radius $R$ and charge density $\rho_1,\rho_2$, respectively. Two centers have distance $d>2R$. Find the total energy of the system.
## Problem 7 (10 pts)
A spherical conductor with radius $R$ and net charge $Q$ is placed at origin. There are two point charges $q_1,q_2$ placed at $(0,0,-r_1)$ and $(0,0,r_2)$, respectively, satisfying $r_1,r_2>R$. Find:\

**(2)** the total electric energy $W_{\text{tot}}$ of the system.
## Problem 8 (5 pts)
A sufficiently long cable with a circle of radius $b$ in the cross section and a copper wire of radius $a$ in the middle. Two circles  are concentric, and between them is vacuum. Find the capacitance per unit length of this cable.
## Problem 9 (15 pts)
The space between the two layers of the metal is divided equally into left and right halves. The left half is filled with a linear dielectric material of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{1r}$, and the right half is filled with a linear dielectric material of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{2r}$.
