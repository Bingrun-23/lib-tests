*side note.* All *side notes* doesn't appear on the real exam paper. However, the **Hints** do. Moreover, some problems may not be described very clearly, but it is similar to the descriptions appeared on the real exam.

## Problem 1 Short Response Questions (20pts)

**(1)** Use the electric field of a point charge to verify the integral form of Gauss Theorem.\
**(2)** Use qualitative or semi-qualitative description to explain the point discharge phenomenon.\
**(3)** Suppose we have a sphere conductor and a point charge outside. To solve the electric field outside the sphere, we put an "image charge" inside the conductor. Does this method contradicts the fact that there is no charge distribution inside a conductor? Why does this method derives the correct field?\
**(4)** Please explain the reason of polarization from a microscopic perspective. Why there is no polarization charge in an isotropic homogeneous dielectric? Use the relationship between the polarization density and polarization vector, modify the Gauss Theorem.

_side note_. The last question is essentially requiring you to prove
$$\oint_S \mathbf{D}\cdot \text{d}\mathbf{a}=\int_V \rho_{f} \text{d}V.$$

## Problem 2
There is a charged ring with radius $R$ and charge density $\lambda$, placed at $xOy$ plane with center identical to the origin.\
**(1)** Suppose $P$ is at $z$-axis. Find the electric field $\mathbf{E}_P$ at point $P$.\
**(2)** Suppose $A$ is at $xOy$ plane, having distance $r_0$ from the origin. If $r_0\ll R$, find the electric field $\mathbf{E}_A$ at point $A$. **Hint**: Use Gauss Theorem. You can assume that, when $x,y,z\ll R$, $E_z(x,y,z)=E_z(z)$ is invariant of $x,y$.
## Problem 3
Three point charges: $q,-2q,q$, are placed at $-l,0,l$ on $x$-axis. A point $P$ is on $x$-axis and has distance $r$ from the origin.\
**(1)** What is the dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$ of the system, assume the reference point is the origin of the coordinate? If the reference point changes, do the dipole moment change?\
**(2)** Suppose $r\gg l$. Find the electric field at $P$.
## Problem 4
A ball has radius $R$ and a hollow sphere inside. This hollow sphere has radius $r$, and its origin has distance $a$ from the origin of the whole ball. Now, the ball is uniformly charged with density $\rho$. Find the electric field in the hollow part. **Hint**: This field is uniform.
## Problem 5
There are two infinite line charges: the first one has density $\lambda$, and is at line $x=\dfrac{d}{2},y=0$; the second one has density $-\lambda$, and is at line $x=-\dfrac{d}{2},y=0$. At plane $xOy$, let $f(z)=\phi(x,y)+\psi(x,y)\cdot i$, where $\phi$ is the electric potential of the system, and $f$ is an analytic function. Find $f$.
## Problem 6
**(1)** A uniformly charged ball has radius $R$ and charge density $\rho$. Find its electric energy.\
**(2)** Now, an extra point charge $q$ is placed outside the ball, with distance $d$ from the origin. Find the interactive energy of the point charge and the ball.\
**(3)** Two uniformly charged ball has radius $R$ and charge density $\rho_1,\rho_2$, respectively. Two centers have distance $d>2R$. Find the total energy of the system.
## Problem 7
A spherical conductor with radius $R$ and net charge $Q$ is placed at origin. There are two point charges $q_1,q_2$ placed at $(0,0,-r_1)$ and $(0,0,r_2)$, respectively, satisfying $r_1,r_2>R$. Find:\
**(1)** the electric force $\mathbf{F}$ exerted on $q_2$;\
**(2)** the total electric energy $W_{\text{tot}}$ of the system.
## Problem 8
A sufficiently long cable with a circle of radius $b$ in the cross section and a copper wire of radius $a$ in the middle. Two circles  are concentric, and between them is vacuum. Find the capacitance per unit length of the system.
## Problem 9
A coaxial cable has inner copper wire with radius $R_1$, filled with dielectric material at radius $R_1<r<R_2$ and a grounded conductor at radius $R_2$. Assume there exists a plane $\mathcal{P}$, passing through the center, such that: the relative dielectric constant is $\varepsilon_{1r},\varepsilon_{2r}$ on two sides of $\mathcal{P}$, respectively.\
**(1)** Use the property of the conductor to derive the direction of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$.\
**(2)** Find $\mathbf{E},\mathbf{P},\mathbf{D}$.\
**(3)** Find surface charge density and surface polarized charge density on each surface.
