# Algorithm Design(算法设计)
 
This course is a course for sophomore. However, it is the prerequisite for some courses, so it may be (?) a good idea to learn it early(?).

- Midterm: 30%
- HW: 30%
- Final: 40%
- Bonus: 4.5% (9 problems, 0.5% each, may be a little different each year)
 
The ones who has OI certificate can skip some of the HW problems.
