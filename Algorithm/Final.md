#Final Exam(40pts,3hrs)
- You can use all the NPC problems whether discussed in class or in HW to do NP-reduction.
- You may need Chernoff bound: Suppose $x_1,\dots,x_n$ are independent random variables in $\{0,1,\}$and $X=x_1+\dots+x_n$.
  Let $\mu=\frac{E[X]}{n}$, then $$Prob(|X-\mu|>\epsilon)\leq 2e^{n\epsilon^2}$$ Other versions us also available, but you may find them
  equivalant in the problems.
- The total points is 40pts and each problem is 5pts. You should do **all the problems in P1~P5** and choose **3 problems from
  P6~P10**. If you choose more than 3, we will consider the three for which you get the highest scores.
