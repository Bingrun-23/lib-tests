- This course is for freshmen in spring semester.

### Notes

1. The midterm 2023 contained a lot of numerical calculations, and the recollection of them after the exam was difficult. However, with the effort of our computers, we had been succeeding in figuring out the numerical values in Problem 9. We searched for every $3\times 3$ matrix with entries being polynomials having degree one, and coefficients ranging from -3 to 3. We checked it by calculating the determinant, being $\lambda^3-\lambda^2$, which was among the few information about the matrix that we could remember after the exam. Among the possible matricies, we finally selected out the true one.
