## Problem 1

$$\sigma_1 = (123)(456), \sigma_2 = (12)(34)(56)$$

$P = \langle\sigma_1, \sigma_2\rangle \leq S_6$

1. Decide whether $P$ is transitive on $[6]$. If it is transitive, decide whether $P$ is primitive, if not, explicitly give a non-trivial block.
2. Perform Sim's sifting algorithm to $P$ and fill in the table $B$. You only need to fill three non-identity element in the table.

## Problem 2

Prove that:
$$
\text{hypergraph isomorphism} <_\text{reducible} \text{bipartite graph isomorphism(left to left, right to right)}
$$

## Problem 3

1. Perform two rounds of column averaging and row averaging on the following matrix.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

2. Will $A$ converge to a doubly stochastic matrix? Brifily explain your answer.

## Problem 4

1. Prove that a simple, undirected graph is acyclic if and only if the associated matrix $A_G \in M(\mathbb Q, |V|\times |V|)$ is nilponent. 
2. Show that if $A_G \in M(\mathbb F_2, |V|\times |V|)$, then 1 is not true.

## Problem 5

Isolation theorem on vertices (not on edges). It's almost the same as the original proof.
