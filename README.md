# lib-tests
A library for saving midterm and final exams of IIIS (Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University). We aim to provide ample exam mocks for all students in IIIS!

> _A passage from the first repo manager [ContributorSiri](https://github.com/ContributorSiri):_

> You may ask what is IIIS? It is a mysterious place where--
> - all the classes are taught in English
> - the Student's Day in 2023 has something to do with [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com)
> - some students can publish their first paper in the freshman year
> - calculating the SVD for a $4\times 5$ matrix is a kind of entertainment for the freshman

## Disclaimer

**All uploaded exam questions are from students' memories or public documents. For students who are about to upload new exam questions or answers, please do not violate the university's exam confidentiality regulations.**

## How to contribute

We welcome everyone in IIIS to upload **exam papers, answers, and cheatsheets**! Every single file is helpful! 

> Q: What is a _cheatsheet_?
> 
> A: In some exams in IIIS, students are allowed to bring some paper reference materials related to the exam, which are called cheatsheets. Because some courses have restrictions on cheatsheets (for example, only one A4 page is allowed), it is necessary to make your own cheatsheet. So, we hope it can be shared too!

To maintain a great structure of the repo, we recommend you to check the following things before _pull request_:

- Your exam papers or answers should in either `.md` (recommended), `.tex`, or `.pdf` (not recommended but OK) format.
    - **IMPORTANT**: If you want to upload an exam answer, please clarify it in the name of the file (for instance, `2025_spring_midterm-answer.md`). If your answer is unofficial, please state it clearly in your file.
- All the images should be added correctly in `./Images`. It should not appear in the subfolders of any course.
- You may also change `README.md` to update course descriptions, instructors, and logistics in each year. We recommend you to write a `README.md` (refer to other `README` for the format) when adding a new course.
- For cheatsheets, `.docx` (not recommended) and `.pdf` are also acceptable. We highly recommend you to check the following:
    - you should upload your cheatsheet inside the `cheatsheet/` subfolder in the folder of the correct course. 
    - you may name your cheatsheet file as `cs_<year>_<name>.<file_type>` (for instance, `midterm_cs_2024_jason.tex` or `cs_2023_yqz.md`).
    - you may change `README.md` in the course folder to record your contribution.
- DO NOT UPLOAD:
    - $\LaTeX$ compiling files `.aux`, `.log`, etc.;
    - Textbooks (which may be too large);
    - Other unrelated stuff.

## Notes
1. Please feel free to contribute to this repository. Also, you can make good use of the exams provided here to help yourself and your friends improve academic skills.
2. Most of the exam papers are written in Markdown or $\LaTeX$. For $\LaTeX$ files, please use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) or your local compiler. For markdown files, since the well known terribleness of Github markdown preview, please download the files for the best experience.
3. In some documents, there may be an introduction part. The part primarily states that the contents may not be absolutely accurate, due to the possible failure of remembering the exam questions after taking it. In fact, most of our exam recitations are done manually (i.e. not directly taking pictures of the exam papers, which should have been forbidden according to the regulations).
4. Before you do the exam problems, please check out the **issues** for possible corrections of the files. Sometimes we may be too busy (or lazy) to modify them.
