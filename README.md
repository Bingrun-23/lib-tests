# lib-tests
A library for saving midterm and final exams of 1115.

## Disclaimer
You may ask what is 1115? It is a mysterious place--
- where all the classes are taught in English
- where the Student's Day has something to do with [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com)
- where some students can publish their first paper in the freshman year
- where calculating the SVD for a 4*5 matrix is the most common entertainment
- ...

If you still don't know what it is about-well, we don't understand as well! :)

## Notes
1. Please feel free to contribute to this repository by uploading the exam papers. Also, you can make good use of the exams provided here to help yourself and your friends improve academic skills.
2. Most of the exam papers are written in $\LaTeX$, and please use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) if the compiling of the documents isn't successful offline.
3. In some documents, there may be an introduction part. The part primarily states that the contents may not be absolutely accurate, due to the possible failure of remembering the exam questions after taking it. In fact, most of our exam recitations are done manually(i.e. not directly taking pictures of the exam papers, which should have been forbidden by the teachers theoretically).
4. Before you do the exam problems, please check out the **issues** for possible corrections of the files. Sometimes we may be too busy (or lazy) to modify them :(

## Updates
1. It's better to use Markdown instead of Latex, since the platform itself already support the preview of Markdown. So for the convience of the users, please use Markdown to write the papers.
