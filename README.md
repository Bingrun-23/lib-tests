# lib-tests
A library for saving midterm and final exams of 1115 (IIIS, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University). We aim to provide ample exam mocks for all students in IIIS!

> You may ask what is 1115? It is a mysterious place--
> - where all the classes are taught in English
> - where the Student's Day in 2023 has something to do with [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com)
> - where some students can publish their first paper in the freshman year
> - where calculating the SVD for a 4*5 matrix is a kind of entertainment for the freshman
> - ...
> 
> If you still don't know what it is about-well, we don't understand as well! :)

## Disclaimer

**All uploaded exam questions are from students' memories or public documents. For students who are about to upload new exam questions or answers, please do not violate the university's exam confidentiality regulations.**

## How to contribute

We welcome everyone in IIIS to upload **exam papers and answers**! Every single file is helpful! 

To maintain a great structure of the repo, we recommend you to check the following things before _pull request_:

- Your exam papers or answers should in either `.md` (recommended), `.tex`, or `.pdf` (not recommended but OK) format.
- All the images should be added correctly in `./Images`. It should not appear in the subfolders of any course.
- You may also change `README.md` to update course descriptions, instructors, and logistics in each year. We recommend you to write a `README.md` (refer to other `README` for the format) when adding a new course.
- DO NOT UPLOAD:
    - $\LaTeX$ compiling files `.aux`, `.log`, etc.;
    - Textbooks (which may be too large);
    - Other unrelated stuff.

## Notes
1. Please feel free to contribute to this repository by uploading the exam papers. Also, you can make good use of the exams provided here to help yourself and your friends improve academic skills. We are also welcome for the exam answers (both _official_ or _unofficial_).
2. Most of the exam papers are written in Markdown or $\LaTeX$. For $\LaTeX$ files, please use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) or your local compiler. For markdown files, since the well known terribleness of Github markdown preview, please download the files for the best experience.
3. In some documents, there may be an introduction part. The part primarily states that the contents may not be absolutely accurate, due to the possible failure of remembering the exam questions after taking it. In fact, most of our exam recitations are done manually (i.e. not directly taking pictures of the exam papers, which should have been forbidden by the teachers theoretically).
4. Before you do the exam problems, please check out the **issues** for possible corrections of the files. Sometimes we may be too busy (or lazy) to modify them.

## Important Updates
